## Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Mobile User Registration and AI Interaction

1. **User Registration:**

   - A new user downloads the mobile application
   - They register using email/password through the `/signup` endpoint
   - The system validates input, creates a user account, and returns a JWT token
   - The user is now authenticated in the application

2. **AI Interaction:**

   - The authenticated user enters a question in the app's chat interface
   - The app sends the question to the `/ask-maia` endpoint
   - The backend validates the request and forwards it to the AI service via Socket.io
   - The AI service processes the request and returns a response
   - The response is stored in the database and returned to the user
   - The conversation appears in the user's chat history

3. **History Management:**
   - The user checks their conversation history via the `/get-logs` endpoint
   - They decide to clear their history using the `/delete-logs` endpoint
   - All conversation logs associated with their account are removed from the database

### Scenario 2: Password Recovery

1. **Initiating Recovery:**

   - A user forgets their password and initiates recovery
   - They enter their email address in the recovery form
   - The application calls the `/forgot-password` endpoint
   - The system generates a 6-digit OTP and sends it to the user's email

2. **OTP Verification:**

   - The user receives the email with the OTP
   - They enter the OTP in the application
   - The application verifies the OTP via the `/check-otp` endpoint
   - Upon verification, the system generates a special reset token

3. **Password Reset:**
   - The user enters a new password
   - The application sends the new password with the reset token to the `/reset-password` endpoint
   - The system verifies the token and updates the user's password
   - The user can now log in with their new password

### Scenario 3: Google OAuth Authentication

1. **OAuth Initiation:**

   - A user chooses to log in with Google
   - The mobile app initiates the Google authentication process
   - The app obtains an ID token from Google

2. **Backend Verification:**

   - The app sends the ID token to the `/google-oauth` endpoint
   - The backend verifies the token with Google's authentication servers
   - The system checks if a user with the same email already exists
   - If not, a new user account is created
   - The system generates a JWT token and returns it to the app

3. **Authenticated Session:**
   - The user is now authenticated in the application
   - They can access personalized features and AI conversation history
   - Their Google profile information is used to personalize their experience

### Scenario 4: Profile Management

1. **Viewing Profile:**

   - An authenticated user checks their profile information
   - The information is displayed based on their stored user data

2. **Updating Profile:**

   - The user decides to update their username
   - They enter the new username in the profile form
   - The app sends the update to the `/edit-profile` endpoint
   - The backend validates and updates the information in the database
   - The updated profile is returned to the app

3. **Account Deletion:**
   - The user decides to delete their account
   - After confirmation, the app calls the `/delete-account` endpoint
   - The backend verifies authentication and deletes the user's data
   - The user is logged out and returned to the registration screen

### Scenario 5: Chatbot Integration

1. **Website Embed:**

   - A business integrates the chatbot widget on their website
   - A website visitor clicks on the chat icon
   - The chatbot interface loads and initiates a session

2. **AI Interaction:**

   - The visitor types a question about the business
   - The chatbot sends the question to the backend
   - The backend processes the request via the AI service
   - A contextually relevant answer is returned and displayed to the visitor

3. **Ongoing Support:**
   - The visitor continues the conversation with follow-up questions
   - The backend maintains context throughout the session
   - The business receives analytics on common questions and user satisfaction

## System Limitations and Future Work

While the current implementation successfully meets the core requirements, some limitations have been identified:

1. **Scalability Considerations:**

   - The current Socket.io implementation may need optimization for very high concurrent loads
   - Database sharding strategy should be implemented for production scaling

2. **Feature Enhancements:**

   - Implementation of advanced analytics for AI conversations
   - Support for multimedia content in conversations
   - Integration with additional authentication providers

3. **Performance Optimizations:**
   - Implementation of Redis caching for frequent database queries
   - Optimization of large conversation history retrievals
   - Background processing for non-critical operations

## Conclusion

The backend implementation successfully provides a secure, scalable, and feature-rich foundation for both mobile applications and chatbot integrations. The API design follows best practices, and the codebase is structured for maintainability and future expansion.

The integration with AI services via Socket.io enables real-time conversation capabilities while maintaining session context. User management features provide a complete authentication and profile management system that supports both traditional credentials and social login options.

This backend implementation meets all the specified requirements and provides a solid foundation for the front-end components to build upon.
